Answer to #3
   The else statement will always make the odd numbers to be even again.
   When numbers are even, the condition if (i % 2 == 0) will be satisfied, and it will always divide the value by 2
   until it reach the last iteration where i = 2 and 2 when half will always equals to 1, 
   Since the condition to terminate the loop while(i > 1) is when i = 1, the loop is guaranteed to stop.
